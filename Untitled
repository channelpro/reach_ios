- Write a specific personalized Subject: Include name, and what my solution offers (Jo have you considered expanding into the MENA)
- Inn subject line: Incite curiosity or utility :
“Advice for a fellow teleological people-person,”
“I do not want anything from you,”
“Your book kept me up all night,”
“I will fly up and see you; you interest me”
“Dan Pink would want me to write a creative subject line here”

Utility:
“Applying your techniques to recovering addicts”
“Getting you to Atlanta”

Both:
“Can you help give away 4 million dollars a year?” [Here, the sender cleverly went on to clarify, “I know the subject sounds like something you'd get from Nigeria, but…”]

- Pain + Solution. What is my solution for a problem they might be having ? (cheap labor for high cost projects)
- Tell them why I chose THEM. What makes them so interesting to me ? SHow that I know their work, and how it is intersting to me.
- Show them my track record. Avoid "I", focus on "You". Highlight a similarity between us (empathy). Referennce some work in their porfolio (building this app for you, would have cost you X $ with us)
- Finish with a Call to action, in the form of a question
- Say thanks and show gratitude !!!
- Install LinkedIn Sales Navigator. Use a tracker to see who opened email
